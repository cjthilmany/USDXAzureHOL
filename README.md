# USDX Hands-On Labs

The USDX hands-on labs (HOLs) have been prepared to give non-Technical Evangelists an overview of Azure as well as four common ISV scenarios. Use this document as a starting point and reference to the HOL material.

Use the [checklist](./USDX%20HandsOn%20Lab%20-%20Checklist.md) to verify you have all the prereqs for the HOLs and then complete any of the five HOLs.
